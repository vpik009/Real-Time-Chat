# Real-Time-Chat

Real time chat application developed using VueJS, Quasar, C#, and Signalr.

The purpose of this application was to test out the usage and suitability of signalr for a real-time chat application. Therefore, this repository contains a demo of the signalr behaviour for real time chat applications with no connections to databases.


To run the application, open the app-ui in a terminal and perform the following:
npm install
npm install @microsoft/signalr
npm install -g @quasar/cli  
quasar dev 

Open the solution file located in Real-Time-Chat using an IDE (ie: Microsoft Visual Studio)
